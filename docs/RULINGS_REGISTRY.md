# THE RULINGS REGISTRY — the ONE machine-held list of what Sam has decided

**Built 2026-08-13 because Sam had to refuse the same question for the third
time in one day.** His words: *"IT SHOULDN'T EVEN BE AN OPTION FOR THE AI TO FIX
A PROBLEM THAT HAS BEEN FIXED"*.

**THIS IS THE LAW REGISTRY'S SHAPE APPLIED TO RULINGS.** Sam ruled on
2026-08-10 that *laws must be machine-held, not remembered*. **Rulings were
not.** They lived in a handoff doc, an archived orders file, and an AWAITING SAM
section — three places, none of which an agent reliably opens. That is why
"already ruled" kept dying.

---

## THE GATE — BINDING ON EVERY AGENT AND ON THE REVIEW SEAT

**1. NO QUESTION REACHES SAM WITHOUT A GREP OF THIS FILE FIRST, AND THE QUESTION
MUST STATE WHAT THE GREP RETURNED.** A question with no stated grep is refused
exactly like an unenforced law is refused. "I grepped `R-` for *game* and found
R-005, which does not cover X" is a legal question. "Can someone have two games
in a week?" is not.

**2. NO WORK STARTS ON A ROW WHOSE STATUS IS `BUILT` WITHOUT FIRST OPENING THE
ENFORCER AND FINDING IT ABSENT.** If it is present, the work is already done —
say so and move on.

**3. A NEW RULING FROM SAM IS ADDED HERE IN THE SAME COMMIT THAT RECORDS IT.**
A ruling captured without a row here is a defect at the moment of capture. This
is the rule three of the census findings died for.

**4. STATUS IS EITHER `BUILT <file:line or commit>` OR `UNENFORCED`.** Two
states only, same as the law registry. "Partly", "in progress" and "should be"
are not states. **A row whose enforcer cannot be named is UNENFORCED, however
true the ruling is.**

---

## HOW TO READ A ROW

`R-nnn` · **SAM'S WORDS, verbatim** · what it means · `STATUS`

**Verbatim matters.** Several defects this week came from an agent paraphrasing
a ruling and then building the paraphrase.

---

## SEASON, FIXTURES, THE WEEK

**R-001** · *"as many games as needed"* · A week may hold any number of games,
on any day. **The profile does NOT grow a second game field — the CALENDAR holds
fixtures; `gameDay` is only a DEFAULT.** ·
`BUILT 3f62ad62` (2026-08-12) — a split round no longer loses its second game.
**⚠ RE-ASKED 2026-08-13 by reading `domain.ts:192` `gameDay?: DayOfWeek` and
concluding "room for one". That single field is not the mechanism.**

**R-002** · *"off season means NO team training, the christmas break is
essentially an off season inside pre season - there is never team trainings
here"* · Off-season has NO team training, ever. The Christmas break is an
off-season inside pre-season. · `BUILT 5dc644ed` (2026-08-13) — Bible `:1440` and
`:1289` amended with his words and a changelog entry; QA scenarios S7 and S5
both corrected (S7 re-phased to pre-season, S5's team days cleared) and the
harness's own team-day violations went 4 -> 0.

**R-003** · *"the athlete can only do COD work in late off season (after first 4
weeks of off season), in christmas break or during pre season if no team
trainings … No COD required in season for anyone."* · The COD gate is: **no team
training this week AND not in season AND not the first four weeks of
off-season.** "After first 4 weeks" = `late_offseason`
(`seasonPhaseClock.ts:72-74`). · `BUILT c086ca3d` (2026-08-13) — `codDecelPermitted`
in `conditioningSelection.ts` is the one rule, read by BOTH gates. The wrong
input was in TWO places, not the one this row named: `defaultProgram.ts:1978`
and `coachingEngine.ts:4126` both read the standing profile. 9 cells in
`test:conditioning-templates`, every line mutation-killed.
**STILL PARTLY UNENFORCED:** the week fact is profile-derived until the dated
no-team-training span exists (item 31 part 5), so a club athlete's December week
still reports team training.

**R-004** · *"that way the app isn't guessing"* · The Christmas break is set by
ASKING: ~10 Dec *"when is your last team training?"*, ~3 Jan *"when does team
training go back?"*. The dates are defaults for WHEN TO ASK, never inferred
answers. · `UNENFORCED` — SEAT_INBOX item 31 part 5.

**R-005** · *"once a session is done then it's locked in, only the rest of the
week can change … wednesday to sunday should adjust to accomodate this"* · A
completed session is locked; the remainder of the week re-shapes around it.
Quiet mid-week re-shaping after a fixture change is WANTED. The lock boundary is
the DATE. · `BUILT` — matches code both halves; stand-down B. **Do not re-ask —
fourth appearance of the granted-permission defect.**

**R-006** · *"Full rest days: 1-2 stands everywhere except bye-recovery weeks and
early off-season, where 3 full rest days are permitted."* · The exception permits
MORE rest, not less. No phase may require zero. · `BUILT` —
`weeklyExposureContractV2.ts:1002,1021,1040,1062` now `required: 1`.

## HARD DAYS AND WEEK SHAPE

**R-007** · *"4 hard days plus 1 moderate/easy day is prefered but 5 hard days is
okay"* · Prefer 4+1; permit 5. **Five is NOT a defect — do not build a
fifth-hard-day block.** · `BUILT` (permission side). Stand-down A.

**R-008** · *"stop worrying about this moderate day thing - this is only on 17 QA
- when we get deeper into the app and test 100 then we will have many more
useful scenarios"* · The 4+1 GENERATION TARGET is **PARKED**. Reopen only when
the harness carries ~100 weeks. · `PARKED BY SAM 2026-08-13` — not owed, not
blocked, not a defect. **Do not re-ask.**

**R-009** · *"should give warnings but allow them to do whatever they want"* ·
The app warns, records and proceeds. **A refusal survives ONLY when the action is
physically impossible.** A 6th hard day is not. This SUPERSEDES Bible `:118`'s
"is refused" on this exact question. · `BUILT b027fef1` — his 6-hard-day sentence
ships.

## SESSIONS AND EXERCISES

**R-010** · *"just keep sessions for gym the same before footy training"* · A gym
session is the same size whatever else is on that day. **No team-night size case,
in either direction.** · `BUILT`.

**R-011** · *"just because the strength is on the same day doesn't mean they are
doing it at the club, they might do it in the morning or on the drive to footy"*
· **Same-day never implies same-place.** Do not reason from one to the other. ·
`BUILT` — the false comment is struck.

**R-012** · *"team training should be looked at more like conditioning - it's not
part of the strength exercises - it's its own component of the day"* · Team
training is its own component, held BY ROLE, not by name. · `BUILT e8521b79`.

**R-013** · **ONE exercise cap for every training age; the beginner cap of 3 was
never authored** (Bible `:3149`, `:4969`) · One cap, all training ages. The
number 3 is abolished. · `UNENFORCED` — `maxExercisesPerStrengthSession` has
ZERO readers; eleven 3-row fallback branches still ship. SEAT_INBOX item 25.

**R-014** · **The session FLOOR has never been ruled.** · Sam has given a
CEILING, not a floor. · `UNRULED — and the question may only reach him in the
item-25 shape:` derive a candidate from his own signed weeks, bring the
DISTRIBUTION and ONE recommendation, let him veto in a word. **A bare "give me a
number" is barred — he refused it 2026-08-13:** *"i've answered this type of shit
so many times"*.

**R-015** · *"On strength days, 2-3 accessory exercises are paired with mobility
exercises as SUPERSETS by default"* (+ 6 further clauses,
`MOBILITY_PAIRING_RULINGS_2026-07-31.md`) · Main lifts are NEVER paired; the
mobility pick must be non-competing; dose is the authored warm-up dose; picks
come from the signed pool; the standalone Mobility session is unchanged. ·
`BUILT` — producer exists; validator no longer caps at one pair.

**R-016** · **Reps are prescribed as a range, shown as a SINGLE MIDDLE NUMBER**
(Bible `:770`, `:4936`) · *"3x8-12 is written as 3x10"*. · `BUILT` — the athlete
sees one number.

## READINESS, AWAY, EQUIPMENT

**R-017** · **A low-readiness declaration deloads a fixed 7-day ROLLING WINDOW**
(Bible `:4961`) · Only the ILLNESS door holds open until cleared. · `BUILT` —
one "cooked" tap no longer deloads forever.

**R-018** · *"Away this week … if yes, follow same program, if no = reselect
equipment … and then the plan should change until their return date"* · Away
RESHAPES the program; it does not avoid the dates. Reuses the onboarding
equipment door with a start and an end date. · `BUILT`.

**R-019** · *"the athlete just removes the equipment they don't have while on the
trip"* · The away equipment answer is a subtraction from the existing list. ·
`BUILT`. **⚠ A three-way question on this was drafted 2026-08-13 and is VOID.**

**R-020** · *"yes clear team training and games while away"* · Away removes team
training and games; the athlete's own sessions stay. · `BUILT`.

**R-021** · *"i've taken out time caps for now"* · No time-cap row renders. **A
DISPLAY ruling, not a deletion order — the `time_limit` kind stays in the type.**
· `BUILT`.

**R-022** · *"i'd rather them shortened"* then ***"signed"*** on four phrases ·
Exercise preference applied / Exercise removed / Exercise prioritised /
Conditioning swapped. **It was FOUR, not three — excluded and pinned are
opposites.** · `BUILT`.

**R-023** · *"yes — one line on week, small card on day, read-only both"* · The
modifier indicator's shape. · `BUILT`.

## LOAD AND THE JOURNAL

**R-024** · **A game's load counts in FULL** (effort x minutes), same unit as
everything else · · `BUILT`.

**R-025** · **Strength asks how long it took** — all four session kinds carry
real load · · `BUILT`.

**R-026** · **Starting load is 50% of calculated, adjusted from there; load is
athlete-owned** (Bible `:3142`) · A starting point, never a ceiling. · `BUILT`
(`loadEstimation.ts:1029-1043`).

## COPY AND THE ATHLETE'S WORDS

**R-027** · **Athlete-facing words are NEVER invented by an agent.** · Every
athlete-facing string is Sam's, or is drafted and shown to him for a one-word
veto. · `BUILT` — `SignedCopy`.

**R-028** · *"Change of Direction/Decel"* · Sam's own sheet tab name IS the COD
label — origin-signed, not an invention. · `BUILT`.

**R-029** · **The shortfall sentence branches BY CAUSE.** · Fixture-caused gets
its own sentence. · `BUILT 1dc52caf` — `section18ShortfallDisclosure.ts:158`
*"With a game {day}, there's only room for …"*, held both directions by
`test:shortfall-copy`. **⚠ RE-ASKED 2026-08-13 as if it did not exist.**

## HOW SAM WANTS TO BE WORKED WITH

**R-030** · *"stop worrying about adding complexity - just tell me if i need to
tell the terminal or claude code something - keep it simple"* · Replies to Sam:
what happened / what's next / what to send. Under 150 words. · `BINDING`.

**R-031** · *"how is it not obvious that I dont want you to just tell me shit
without updating what i need to tell the terminal?"* · Any answer that creates
work is written to the inbox BEFORE it is said in chat. · `BINDING`.

**R-032** · *"i need you to be shorter in your responses - its too confusing when
you write too much"* · Length is itself a defect. Being right buys no extra
words. · `BINDING`.

**R-033** · *"There has to be a better way than me hand-testing"* / *"my phone is
the last instrument"* · Sam is never the test rig. A change that alters an
EXISTING week is unverified until seen on a week that already existed. ·
`UNENFORCED as a gate` — SEAT_INBOX item 30.

## FROM THE BIBLE'S OWN CHANGELOG (§19), seeded 2026-08-13

**Every entry there is a ruling by construction** — the changelog exists because
Sam ruled that the Bible is AMENDED when a ruling supersedes it, and each entry
names the text it replaced. **25 of the 54 entries carry `(Sam, <date>)` and are
rows here.** The remaining 29 are Amendment-Pass edits that record WHERE a
superseded line lived rather than a fresh decision; they are covered by the row
their pass produced.

**R-034** · *"Main lifts HALF the sets at RPE 5-6 … power/speed KEPT as a small
sharp dose; conditioning HALF the total work with at most one quality
exposure"* · THE DELOAD LAW. A deload is authored content, not "less volume".
**Power is NOT removed on a deload.** · `BUILT` — `test:deload-law`, green.

**R-035** · *"low readiness means one thing: the next 7 days are deloaded"* ·
THE READINESS LAW. A ROLLING 7-day window from the declaration day, not the rest
of the calendar week. **The tier TYPE is retired** — readiness exposes
deloaded-or-not and nothing else. · `BUILT` — `test:readiness-illness-law`, green.

**R-036** · MILD training unchanged · MODERATE deloaded while the fact is ACTIVE
· SEVERE the authored return ladder · THE ILLNESS LAW, three tiers, all riding
the deload law rather than carrying illness-specific dosing. ·
`BUILT` — `test:readiness-illness-law`, green.

**R-037** · Three sick doors, not two · THE THREE SICK DOORS. With only two, the
law's MODERATE tier had **no producer, no storage and no way for an athlete to
reach it** — a flu-level illness either did nothing or emptied the week. ·
`BUILT` — `test:readiness-illness-law`, green.

**R-038** · *"Tired"* (noted only) · *"Wrecked"* (7 days deloaded) ·
*"Absolutely cooked"* (7 days deloaded AND every session optional) · THE
READINESS DOOR, THREE TIERS. His labels, verbatim. ·
`BUILT` — `test:readiness-illness-law`, green.

**R-039** · Fatigue EXPOSURE-BLOCKING **abolished**. A severity-7 signal blocked
nine exposure types and collapsed strength sessions to Rest — a count reduction
by SIDE EFFECT. · `UNENFORCED` — no suite named for it; the abolition is recorded
in the Bible and I could not name an enforcer.

**R-040** · RAW SEVERITY IS PRIVATE TO THE DOOR. No module outside the minting
door may read a readiness/fatigue severity, tier or magnitude; downstream
consumes the two flags only. · `BUILT` — `test:readiness-ownership`, green.
**⚠ I FIRST CITED A LAW ID THAT DOES NOT EXIST** (`LAW-raw-severity-is-private`);
grepped `lawRegistry.ts` and it returns ZERO. The nearest real rows are
`LAW-day-readiness-doors-are-direct` and `LAW-tired-severity-icon-ladder`,
neither of which holds this. **Citation removed rather than repaired** — a
fabricated reference in THIS file is the exact failure it exists to stop.

**R-041** · READINESS IS A HOMONYM. Two unrelated signals share the name — the
athlete's DECLARATION and a CAPACITY score from onboarding. **Ten call sites
belong to the capacity score and are deliberately untouched.** ·
`UNENFORCED` — a naming hazard, not a behaviour; nothing reds if they re-merge.

**R-042** · Section 18 `illness_recovery` week-mode dosing **DELETED**. It
predated the law and carried its own dosing — two representations, and the wrong
one was running. · `BUILT` — `test:illness-recovery-mode`, green.

**R-043** · Conditioning progression machinery **DELETED, not migrated**.
`TIER_CAPS` were invented numbers quietly deciding an athlete's dose. ·
`BUILT` — `test:conditioning-progression-inputs` asserts the retirement.

**R-044** · Beginners follow the universal phase table in EVERY phase. **The last
beginner-specific structural rule in the Bible, and the authority the code's
`maxCoreSessions: 2` rested on — both gone.** ·
`BUILT` — `trainingAgePolicy.ts` NORMAL_POLICY, `test:rules-kernel`.

**R-045** · *"do not overload them with too many exercises"* is guidance about
dose and complexity, **not a numeric limit** · ONE exercise cap for every
training age. The beginner-only cap of 3 was never authored. ·
`BUILT trainingAgePolicy.ts:43` (`maxExercisesPerStrengthSession: 6`)
**but ⚠ THE CAP IS NOT ENFORCED — it has one reader and that reader FORWARDS it
to the AI prompt. Eight sessions ship SEVEN counted rows (SEAT_INBOX item 25).**

**R-046** · *"Running: 2 days minimum per week, 3 preferred, 4 hard max. Team
training counts toward the running days. The app programs 3 by default."* ·
THE RUNNING LAW. **THREE numbers, not one** — floor 2, preferred 3, hard max 4.
A 4th running day is VALID everywhere and merely unusual; only a 5th breaches. ·
`UNENFORCED` — no suite named for the three-number split.

**R-047** · Muscle/experience sheet reconciliation. **MetCon DELETED** — the
conditioning ruling retiring the name wins over the muscle sheet. ·
`BUILT` — `test:muscle-experience`, green.

**R-048** · THE EXPERIENCE CROSSWALK — the single authored bridge from the
onboarding answer to the ladder (new / developing / consistent / advanced) to the
authored exercise gates. **Regressions are visible.** ·
`BUILT` — `test:muscle-experience`, green.

**R-049** · *"Dose counts main work only. Warm-up and cool-down never count
toward a session's conditioning dose."* · `BUILT` — `test:conditioning-dose`,
green, anchored by `ALL-COND-DOSE-DESCRIPTOR-01`.

**R-050** · THE OPTIONAL PLACEMENT LAW (§20.1). Optional placement is permitted
under stated conditions. **SUPERSEDES the blanket ban an agent generalised from
his words — that generalisation would have red-flagged his own authored early
off-season all-optional contracts.** · `BUILT` — `test:optional-topup`, green.

**R-051** · THE REST LAW (§20.2). **A day holding only optional work is still
rested, and the week reports both.** · `BUILT` — the rest floor
(`weeklyExposureContractV2` `required: 1` on all four rows, `afd07164`).

**R-052** · GUNSHOW COMPOSITION (§20.3), signed · **2 biceps + 2 triceps + 2
pump delts at 2-3 sets.** Supersedes the app's 2+2+1+1 shape whose fourth slot
reached outside the sixteen signed candidates. **Shrink-never-pad.** ·
`UNENFORCED` — no suite named for the composition.

**R-053** · MOBILITY COMPOSED FROM THE POOL (§20.4), signed. **The ten
`MOBILITY_FLOW_TEMPLATES` bundles are NOT recognised** — no ruling cited, no
changeset, no divergence report. · `BUILT` — `test:mobility-accessory-doors`,
green (21 cells, his 2-3 pairs survive the validator).

**R-054** · THE SEVEN STRENGTH SESSIONS (§20.5), signed. The athlete's own door
could previously reach only four of the seven. · `UNENFORCED` — no suite named
for the door's coverage of all seven.

**R-055** · THE FOUR QUESTIONS (§20.6), signed. For any type the app may place,
**"who may place it" is answered by a signed placement rule, not by the word
"generator"**. · `BUILT` — `test:session-type-charter`, green;
`CHARTER_DEBT` is where the app does not yet answer them.

**R-056** · *"off season means NO team training … so these are the only times COD
may be useful"* · THE COD WINDOW (2026-08-13). Duplicate of R-002/R-003 as a
Bible amendment; kept as its own row because the changelog entry is the Bible's
record and R-002/R-003 are the inbox's. · `BUILT 5dc644ed, c086ca3d`.

## SEEDING IS INCOMPLETE AND THAT IS STATED, NOT HIDDEN

**56 rows. There are more.** Seeded from `COWORK_SEAT_HANDOFF_2026-08-13.md`'s
"RULINGS MADE TODAY", `SEAT_INBOX.md`'s answered `## AWAITING SAM` entries, the
stand-downs, `SEAT_INBOX_ORIGINAL_ORDERS_2026-08-13.md`, and
`RULINGS_NOT_IN_THE_APP_2026-08-13.md`.

**THE BIBLE CHANGELOG IS NOW SEEDED (2026-08-13)** — 25 of its 54 entries carry
`(Sam, <date>)` and are rows R-034..R-056. The other 29 are Amendment-Pass edits
recording WHERE a superseded line lived rather than a fresh decision.

**NOT YET SEEDED — do these next, and add rows as you go:** the 70
`*_RULING*.md` docs in `docs/`, and `LFA_PROGRAMMING_POLICY_DECISIONS.md`.

**Until seeding is complete, a grep that returns NOTHING is not proof a ruling
does not exist** — say so in the question rather than claiming he never decided.
