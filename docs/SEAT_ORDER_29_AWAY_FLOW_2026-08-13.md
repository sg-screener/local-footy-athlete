# ORDER 29 — THE AWAY FLOW, full text, archived 2026-08-13

**Archived because it is BUILT and it was the single largest thing in the live
inbox — 13.5KB of 65KB, a fifth of what every agent re-read at every stop.**
Sam, 2026-08-13: *"once something is fixed and commited though, those notes
dont need to be there anymore do they?"* They do not.

**Do not read this file. Grep it** — only if a claim in the inbox summary is
challenged.

29. **THE AWAY FLOW IS BUILT — full report in
    `docs/AWAY_FLOW_BOUNDARY_2026-08-13.md`.**
    **WORKING, seen on glass:** the week-shape control, the leave date, the
    unbounded return date, the equipment question and its dated span, the GAME
    coming off the week during a trip, and a fixture inside the trip no longer
    anchoring its week.
    **STILL SHOWING: the team night on a combined day.** The card's words come
    from `getSessionComponents`, and the two-field fix for it measured WORSE on
    the real day — it took his gym session off the card. The exact next place is
    named in the boundary report.
    **Held by `test:away-flow` (36 cells), `test:day-first-timeline`,
    `test:program-control-durable`.**

## SAFE FOR A PARALLEL AGENT — context, not orders

**This heading is the stop hook's region terminator** (`repoLawGuardsTests.ts:252`
`INBOX_ORDERS_END`). **Everything below it is invisible to the hook, which is
correct — nothing below is an order. Do not put an order here, and do not rename
this heading.**

**SAM OWNS THE UI AND IS WORKING ON IT NOW.** *"i like how the app is looking
now - but i have a few more UI tweaks to make and then it's all about getting it
functioning like a proper app with my logic fully in the app"*. **"Fully in the
app" means CONSUMED, not present** — that phrase is the whole queue above.
**LANDED by Codex 2026-08-12:** the day/week toggle staying put across weeks, and
the 7-day chip grid (4+3). **Still his:** edit icons on injury tap-throughs; icon
colours in the flat button; icon sizes; recovery icon → full battery; weekly-view
buttons (*Away this week* + equipment yes/no → bodyweight; *Practice match*
removed from the day screen in pre-season; *Bye* as a weekly-only in-season
button); an add/move/swap/remove entry point on the weekly view. **Plus "add a
game", which is BLOCKED on item 5.**
**Do not start these and do not "help".** Merging them is item 1a.

**BUTTON REMOVAL, ALWAYS:** ~49 tap sites sit in files that read as live
(`HomeScreenClassic` is inside the file the navigator mounts, behind a
compile-time const). **Prove a control is REACHABLE before removing it, and
report the ones you could not reach** — those are the finding.
`LAW-L5-no-dead-affordances` is UNENFORCED, so nothing catches a mistake here.

**THE MERGE LEFTOVERS CENSUS** (`docs/WHAT_THE_MERGE_LEFT_BEHIND_2026-08-12.md`)
found: **ZERO controls an athlete can tap that do nothing**; five half-finished
moves (items 8, 12, 15 above cover them); seven of eight surfaces with no current
picture (item 12). **The journal was NOT touched** — one commit, one line, a
shared data-shape change its readers correctly followed. Sam was right and the
seat was wrong.

## AWAITING SAM — parked behind his phone rebuild, never a request

- **ANSWERED 2026-08-13, AND HIS ANSWER IS BIGGER THAN THE QUESTION — AWAY IS A
  BYE-WEEK BUILD.** Sam, verbatim: *"If you're away, you're not playing, so a
  taper and a recovery day would be training for a match you're not at. The other
  side: your season view quietly loses a game that really happened. The period
  you're away should almost look like a bye week build or an off season block
  with no team training, ensuring that when you treat when you get back enough
  time to recover before the next game so you wouldn't do heavy legs on a friday
  when you are travelling home that day just because you're away, a game still
  may be that weekend"*.

  **THE RULING, AS ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:**
  1. **A fixture INSIDE the trip does not ANCHOR the week** — no G-1 taper, no
     G+1 recovery. He is not playing it.
  2. **⚠ CORRECTED BY SAM THE SAME DAY, AND MY RECOMMENDATION IS OVERRULED.**
     I recommended leaving his calendar mark alone. He said: *"i think the game
     should be removed if the athlete is away … the game on the 15th should be
     removed or at least blanked out"*. **So the fixture inside the trip GOES
     from the week — removed, or blanked so it plainly is not his to play.**
     He had already weighed the cost he named (*"your season view quietly loses
     a game that really happened"*) and ruled anyway. **Do not re-argue it.**
  3. **The away period is shaped like a BYE WEEK BUILD or an off-season block,
     with no team training.**
  4. **A fixture AFTER he returns still shapes the tail of the trip.** No heavy
     legs on the Friday he flies home if there is a game that weekend.

  **THE APP ALREADY HAS THE SHAPE HE NAMED, which is why this is small.**
  `derivedWeekContract.ts:92-102`: a week with NO FIXTURE derives
  `anchorState: 'bye'` and mode `in_season_bye_build`. **So dropping fixtures
  that fall inside the away span — at the one fixture owner,
  `targetWeekFixtures` (`rules/fixtureConditionedAvailability.ts:141`) — gives
  all four at once:** no anchor for the game he misses (1); the mark untouched,
  because the filter is on the READ and not the store (2); a bye-week build for
  the span (3); and a fixture OUTSIDE the span still anchoring, so the
  travel-home Friday is still G-1 (4).

  **HIS WORKED EXAMPLE IS THE ACCEPTANCE TEST, verbatim** — *"they leave thursday
  august 13th and get back friday 21st of august. Team training should be removed
  thursday tuesday and thursday (if they train those nights), and the game on the
  15th should be removed or at least blanked out, but the next saturday the 22nd
  game is still alive and there training on wednesday thursday friday the
  following week needs to not kill them for that return"*.

  **UNFOLDED, and every line is checkable:**
  - Away span **Thu 13 Aug → Thu 20 Aug** (back Friday the 21st).
  - Team nights **Thu 13, Tue 18, Thu 20** all go.
  - **Sat 15 game: GONE.** That week (10-16) has no fixture left, so it derives
    `anchorState: 'bye'` / `in_season_bye_build` — the shape he named.
  - **Sat 22 game: ALIVE.** Its week (17-23) is HALF AWAY: Mon-Thu inside the
    trip, Fri 21 the travel home, game Saturday.
  - **So the tail of the trip is still G-2 and G-1** — Thu 20 and Fri 21 — and
    must not *"kill them for that return"*. **This falls out of the same filter
    rather than needing its own rule: the 22nd is outside the span, so it
    anchors, and its taper reaches back into days the athlete is still away.**

  **THE MIXED WEEK IS THE REAL TEST.** A cell that only walks a wholly-away week
  cannot see criterion 4 at all.

  **BUILT 2026-08-13, AND IT NEEDED NO WIRING AT ALL.** The filter went in at
  `derivedWeekContract`'s `fixtureIdentityForWeek`, which **already receives
  `temporarySourceFacts`** — so the trip was in scope the whole time and the
  seven `targetWeekFixtures` callers never had to be threaded.
  **His worked example is a cell:** `test:away-flow` [14]-[14d] — both weeks are
  game weeks first (non-vacuity), then the 15th's week becomes
  `anchorState: 'bye'` / `in_season_bye_build` and the 22nd's week stays a game
  week. **Mutation-checked:** disabling the filter reds [14b].
  **AND IT REACHES THE WEEK THE ATHLETE IS ALREADY LOOKING AT** — which is what
  item 30 had been chasing through the deriving lane and failing. The effect is
  DERIVED, so `changedProgram` is true while NO overlay is authored and NO
  reversible adjustment is minted (`test:program-control-durable`). **Store the
  decision, derive everything else** — the deriving lane was the wrong tool and
  is what made the door refuse on a real world.
  **AND THE CARD IS DONE TOO, 2026-08-13, after he said the halfway version was
  not good enough:** *"no it shouldn't show + team training and the game really
  should just be removed as well … if the person is away, consider the time they
  are away as building a new program and their old program is gone for the time
  being … thats clunky and unprofessional"*.
  **HIS FRAMING IS THE FIX AND IT NAMED THE GAP I HAD BEEN PATCHING AROUND.** The
  two earlier filters both change what a week *IS* — the plan stops marking team
  days, a fixture stops anchoring. **Neither touches a week that was ALREADY
  STORED with the club on it, and that is the week he is looking at.** So the
  third filter is on the READ: `applyAwayPass` in `sessionResolver`, the last
  pass of `resolveWeekWithConditioning`. A fixture inside the trip stands down to
  an empty day; a team night is stripped from its day and a club-only day empties;
  a combined day keeps its own half, renamed through the one owner.
  **IT IS A FILTER, NOT AN EDIT.** His calendar mark, his accepted program and the
  team night all still exist and all come back when the fact expires or he clears
  it. Held by `test:away-flow` [15]/[15b], non-vacuity first; mutation-checked.

  **⚠ AND IT DOES NOT REACH THE PROGRAM TAB. MEASURED, NOT SUSPECTED,
  2026-08-13.** A probe at the top of `applyAwayPass`, run through the real flow
  against a logged Metro, **never fired once** — while a probe in the coaching
  engine on the same run did. **So `resolveWeekWithConditioning` is NOT what
  draws the athlete's week**, even though `buildProgramTabProjectedWeek` appears
  to call it and `useResolvedWeek` → `projectWeekFor` →
  `buildProgramTabProjectedWeek` is the documented chain.
  **THE READER IS FOUND, AND IT IS THE ONE I ALREADY EDITED — which makes the
  remaining gap NARROW AND STRANGE. Measured 2026-08-13 with probes at four
  layers, twice, the second time on a cache-cleared Metro:**
  `projectWeekFor` (9 calls) → `buildProgramTabProjectedWeek` (18) →
  `resolveWeekWithConditioning` (61, twenty of them WITH the travel fact
  present, `facts=1`). **So the chain is exactly as documented and the fact
  reaches it.**
  **⚠ AND `applyAwayPass` — the LAST LINE of that same function — logged ZERO
  times.** Both of the function's two returns call it (`:1732` and `:2181`,
  verified by listing every `return` in the body and every top-level `}`), the
  function is entered 61 times, and its final pass is never reached. **I cannot
  explain that, and I am not guessing a fifth time.**
  **THE PROBE WAS RUN AND IT FOUND THE LINE — `sessionResolver.ts:1729`,
  `if (!state.seasonPhase) return baseDays`.** Two stamps added in ONE edit:
  the top of `resolveWeekWithConditioning` fired 61 times, the pass at the bottom
  ZERO. **`state.seasonPhase` is empty in the state the screen builds, so the
  whole conditioning tail is skipped and the athlete's week is `resolveWeek`'s
  output — every filter added below that line over two days could never run.**
  **THE EARLY RETURN NOW RUNS THE AWAY PASS TOO** (`:1729`). All suites green.
  **⚠ AND IT IS NOT PROVEN ON GLASS, because the instrument stopped being
  trustworthy.** Late in the session Metro repeatedly served a STALE bundle: an
  edit would compile, the flow would run, and the new stamp would not appear
  while older stamps in the same file did. **Two conclusions were drawn from that
  silence and both were wrong.**
  **THE INSTRUMENT FAULT WAS THREE ORPHANED METRO PROCESSES ON ONE PORT.** Kill
  them all, start ONE `--clear`, and put a CONTROL (change an existing log's
  text) in the same edit as the test. **Every "it never fired" conclusion taken
  before that is void.**
  **THE REAL DEFECT: `resolveWeekWithConditioning` HAS THREE EXITS** — the
  no-season guard, `return section18TierFour({...})` at `:1894`, and the final
  line. A real week has a stored §18 contract and leaves at the MIDDLE one, so
  every filter added at the bottom over two days never ran. Wrapped.
  **GAME: OFF ON GLASS** — Saturday reads "Training Day". **TEAM NIGHT: STILL
  SHOWING**, and the two-field fix for it was measured WORSE on the real day (it
  took his gym session off the card). **Full account, and the exact next place —
  the team identity the real workout carries in its `sections` — is in
  `docs/AWAY_FLOW_BOUNDARY_2026-08-13.md`.**

## Previously (now processed)

`docs/SEAT_INBOX_COMPLETED_2026-08-13.md` — items 0, 0a-0f, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12,
15, 16, 19 and 23, moved out of the queue 2026-08-13 **verbatim, byte-identical,
nothing reworded**. Each was a BUILT stub with no open sub-order.

`docs/SEAT_INBOX_ARCHIVE_TO_2026-08-10.md` — most recently the craft validator,
cleared 2026-08-12. **This file holds LIVE ORDERS ONLY.** It was 353KB once and
every stop paid to re-read it.

## HOUSEKEEPING (not an order — the hook stops scanning before here)

**WHEN YOU ARE STUCK ON AN ITEM, MARK IT AND WORK THE NEXT ONE.** Sam,
2026-08-13: *"batch — and when you're stuck on an item, move to the next item
instead of stopping. Only stop when the whole list is blocked."* Put
**`BLOCKED-BY: sam`**, **`BLOCKED-BY: other-agent`** or **`BLOCKED-BY: external`**
**on the item's HEAD line** — column 0 is all the hook reads, so a marker in the
body silences nothing — and write the question underneath. The hook then walks
past it to the next order. **When every remaining item is marked, and only then,
the turn ends and his questions reach him in one batch.** Those three words are
the whole list; an invented category marks nothing. **A commit subject is no
longer an exit — `docs(blocked):` does not end a turn.**

**EVERY ORDER LIVES UNDER `## Unprocessed`. Sub-headings inside it MUST be
`###`.** `scripts/seat-inbox-hook.sh` bounds its scan at the next `## `, so an
order under its own `## ` heading is INVISIBLE to the stop hook and Sam becomes
the courier. The seat did this twice on 2026-08-12. **A guard cell now exists
(`1fcf5c04`) — but keep orders in ONE numbered sequence anyway: three schemes
(000/00/0a/0 plus a second 1-4 inside a context section) is why the terminal
picked the wrong item three times.**
